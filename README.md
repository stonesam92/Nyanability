# Nyanability: iOS8 Reachability + Nyan Cat

When Apple released the larger iPhone 6 and 6S, they introduced Reachability, a feature which allows users of these devices to access the upper parts of app's UI.

Nyanability takes this feature one step further, ensuring that the Nyan Cat is also always within a user's reach.

Works in any app which shows a reachability window (I think everything except Springboard).

## Why?

Nyanability was created while playing around with ideas for making the most out of Reachability's space.

## How do I get it?

Since no one should seriously want this on their phone, Nyanability has not been submitted to any Cydia repo. If you would like to try it out, clone this project and build it, or download the .deb manually from the project releases section.
